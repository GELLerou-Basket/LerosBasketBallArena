# LerosBasketBallArena
A basket ball game in a half basketball court with launchers, basket and a displaying screen. Highly customized in setup mode (choosing team names, time and shots per player e.t.c), the construction automatically counts the score of each player detecting the difficulty of each launcher and the success of a shot.
